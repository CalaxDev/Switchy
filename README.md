# Switchy

## Introduction

A little "Window Switching" Application I created for Leon of Bonjwa.  

It currently uses the .Net 8.0 Framework and the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) Framework.

## Run the Application

Hopefully, a GitHub Releases Page exists by now. If not, continue with **Development** and built the Binary yourself.

**Requirements:**

* The [.NET Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
  * Select either .Net 8.0 or .Net 8.1, download and install the `.NET Desktop Runtime`

## Development

**Requirments:**

* Visual Studio 2022 (or Visual Studio Code if you are a daredevil)
* .Net 8.0 SDK (or higher)

After installing everything simply open the .sln-File with Visual Studio or the project folder with VSCode and you should be good to go.
